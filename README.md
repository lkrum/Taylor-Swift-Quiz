# Taylor-Swift-Quiz

## Description
Given the starter code, I created a JavaScript program to create a randomized password that meets specific sets of criteria. First, the password has to be between 8 and 128 characters in length. The user also has to select at least one character type from the following list: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or symbols. Once the user selections are made, a randomized value appears in the box under "Generate a Password."
